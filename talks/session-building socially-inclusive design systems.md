She asked this:

* How did we get here?
* How do we fix it?
* How do we prevent it?


## Component-Based -> Accessible

Reducing design elements to the smallest replicable unit

[Or in other words KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), why asking the gender? Is it necessary? Don't think so..]

    gender !== gender pronouns

If we look at the slide, we can see an exclusionary form

    Form -> Pattern -> Product registration -> Product -> Industry

What happens if we creata an exclusionary form? That, in the end, we create an exclusionary product.
Is a positive feedback loop.

## Comprehensive -> Inclusive

    Who are we missing?
    
    BENJAMIN EVANS
    Inclusive Design Lead, Airbnb

IMPACT -> There's no place for you here -> EXCLUSION (unintentional?)

Data:
* 83% of tech executives are white - TechRepublic
* Men outnumber women 4:1 in STEM - Forbes

    Opinions are like biases. Everyone's got one.
    But we pretend like we don't have them.

[If we are aware that we have biases, it's easy to educate ourselves]

Gonzo journalism: a style of journalism created without claims of objectivity, often including the journalist as part of the journalist via first-person narrative.

Gonzo design: a style of design created without claims of objectivity, often including the designer as part of the system via first-person narrative.

    Show the makeup of your team!

* race, orientation, ability, socioeconomic, religion, philosophy, nationality, language..

[but for that we need a DIVERSE team!]

If all of this is present, all users will be present :)


## Cooperative -> Adaptable

There is a positive feedback loop between Users and Designers

[A bug.. sure..]

1️⃣ Resist the urge to centre yourself or to make excuses

2️⃣ Apologise for impact

3️⃣ Make a plan to fix

4️⃣ Remember for next time

Change transphobic for sexist, racist, ableism, understand the impact of the design.
